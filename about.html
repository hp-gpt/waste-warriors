    <div class="about-info">
        Mother Earth is quietly suffocating, as we carelessly dispose non-degradable waste. Every item thrown without
        thought adds weight to a planet. Only about 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled globally. Most
        plastic ends up in landfills, incinerators, or the environment. About 93% of aluminum beverage cans sold in the
        UAE end up in landfills instead of being recycled. Roughly 12 million plastic containers are sold every day in
        the UAE, with most not recycled. <br><br>

        It is the duty of the youth to turn awareness into action. We are a school-led Recyclables Donation Drive
        organised and managed by Grade 9 students. Our aim is simple: to reduce waste, encourage recycling, and make
        students aware of how
        small actions can create a positive impact on the environment. By giving recyclable waste a second life,
        we reduce landfill burden and protect our planet. Every item donated is a choice to care, and a promise by
        students to build a cleaner future.<br><br>

        Designed by a team of waste-hating, landfill-allergic, slightly sleep-deprived students who care about the
        planet,<br><br>
        <li>Dhriti Bengani "The Overthinker"</li>
        <li>Jannah Fathima "The Ideator"</li>
        <li>Vihaan Nair "The Politician"</li>
        <li>Harsh Purohit "The Hacker"</li>
        <li>Siddhant Karve "The Comic Relief"</li> <br>


        This project also uses basic technology developed by students. Our website helps register donations, generate QR
        codes for verification, and maintain accurate digital records of the materials collected. This allows
        transparency, efficiency, and real-time tracking of donations. We also partner with scrap buyers and waste
        management companies to ensure that the recycled goods are put to good use, giving them a new life! <BR>

        But while we do the best we can, we also need our community to work with us to make our earth greener from
        today. Donate today and help us out! A big thank you to everyone who's visited the site and donated! <br><br>
