                    <h2> Plastic Waste</h2>
                    Plastic is widely used due to its durability, but this same quality makes it difficult
                    to manage as waste. Over 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year, yet only a small
                    percentage is successfully recycled. Much of this waste ends up in landfills and oceans, where it
                    can remain for centuries. <br><br>

                    To recycle plastic effectively, items should be rinsed and sorted according to local recycling
                    rules. Checking plastic identification codes can help determine recyclability. Contaminated or mixed
                    plastics should be avoided, as they can disrupt the recycling process.

                    <h2>Paper Waste</h2> <br>

                    Paper waste forms a significant part of household and commercial waste, making up nearly 25 to 30
                    percent of municipal solid waste worldwide. The good news is that paper is highly recyclable, and
                    recycling just one ton can save trees, water, and energy used in producing new paper. Most paper
                    products can be recycled several times before the fibers weaken.<br><br>

                    For proper recycling, paper should be clean, dry, and free from food or grease. Items like used
                    tissues or oily cardboard are not suitable for recycling. Flattening cardboard boxes and avoiding
                    paper with heavy plastic coatings helps improve recycling efficiency.

                    <h2>Metal Cans</h2> <br>
                    Metal cans, such as aluminum and steel cans, are among the most efficient materials to recycle.
                    Aluminum can be recycled repeatedly without losing quality, while also saving a large amount of
                    energy compared to producing new metal. Recycled cans can often be reused within weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    Cans should be emptied and lightly rinsed before recycling. Labels can remain on the cans, as they
                    are removed during processing. Crushing cans is usually acceptable and helps reduce space in
                    recycling bins.

                    <h2>E-Waste</h2><br>
                    Electronic waste includes discarded devices like phones, computers, chargers, and
                    batteries. It is one of the fastest-growing waste streams worldwide and contains both valuable
                    materials and harmful substances. Improper disposal can lead to environmental and health risks.
                    <br> <br>
                    E-waste should always be taken to authorized recycling centers or collection programs. Personal data
                    should be removed from devices before recycling, and batteries should be handled separately when
                    possible to ensure safe processing.
